# chess2.0

This is my second attempt in creating a chess game. However, this time, I will be using javascript to build it. Let's see how it goes! :)

There are two types of move logic for the pieces. For straight lines, I tried the method of getting the whole line, then chopping off start and end to reveal the avaliable moves. For diagonals, I implemented a recursion function that also supports the knight as a special case.

The project is pretty well commented and should be easily readable. Happy playing and coding everyone. :)
